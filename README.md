# Octodexinreact

My goal was to create a web page that displayed the GitHub mascot which calls OctoCat from GitHub using:
<a href="https://www.w3.org/">Html</a>
CSS
React
API
VS Code

I am proud of this project because I learned to create an application with React and API at the same time to reinforce my knowledge in Html, CSS using VS Code as a tool.
